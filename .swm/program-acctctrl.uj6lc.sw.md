The program starts with the PREMIERE SECTION, which initializes the necessary data and variables. It then calls the GET-NUMBER-OF-ACCOUNTS-DB2 SECTION to retrieve the number of accounts for a given sort code from a database. The result is then displayed using the DISPLAY statement. Finally, the program exits using the EXIT statement.

```
       PREMIERE SECTION.
       P010.



           MOVE SORTCODE TO
              REQUIRED-SORT-CODE.

           PERFORM GET-NUMBER-OF-ACCOUNTS-DB2


      D    DISPLAY 'OUTPUT DATA IS='
      D       DFHCOMMAREA.


           PERFORM GET-ME-OUT-OF-HERE.
```
