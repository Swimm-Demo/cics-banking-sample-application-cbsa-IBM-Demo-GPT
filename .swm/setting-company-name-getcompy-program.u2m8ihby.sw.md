## What the Program Does

The GETCOMPY program is designed to set the company name for the CICS Bank Sample Application. It achieves this by moving a predefined string 'CICS Bank Sample Application' into the <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/GETCOMPY.cbl" pos="38:15:17" line-data="           move &#39;CICS Bank Sample Application&#39; to COMPANY-NAME.">`COMPANY-NAME`</SwmToken> variable and then returning control to CICS.

## Program Flow

### PREMIERE SECTION

First, the program sets the company name by moving the string 'CICS Bank Sample Application' into the <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/GETCOMPY.cbl" pos="38:15:17" line-data="           move &#39;CICS Bank Sample Application&#39; to COMPANY-NAME.">`COMPANY-NAME`</SwmToken> variable. Then, it returns control to CICS using the <SwmToken path="src/base/cobol_src/GETCOMPY.cbl" pos="40:1:5" line-data="           EXEC CICS RETURN">`EXEC CICS RETURN`</SwmToken> statement.

```cobol
       PREMIERE SECTION.
       A010.
           move 'CICS Bank Sample Application' to COMPANY-NAME.

           EXEC CICS RETURN
           END-EXEC.
