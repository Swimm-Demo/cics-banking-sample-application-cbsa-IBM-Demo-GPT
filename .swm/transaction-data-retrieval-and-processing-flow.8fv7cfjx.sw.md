This document will cover the Transaction Data Retrieval and Processing Flow, which includes:

1. Initiating the transaction retrieval process
2. Fetching transaction data from the database
3. Processing and formatting the data into a JSON response
4. Terminating the database connection.

# [Initiating the Transaction Retrieval Process](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBY2ljcy1iYW5raW5nLXNhbXBsZS1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi1jYnNhLUlCTS1EZW1vLUdQVCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/l0j8exmr#retrieving-and-processing-transaction-data)

The transaction retrieval process begins when a request is made to retrieve transaction data. This request can include parameters such as `limit` and `offset` to specify the number of transactions to retrieve and the starting point for retrieval. This step is crucial for ensuring that the system retrieves the correct subset of transaction data based on user requirements.

# [Fetching Transaction Data from the Database](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBY2ljcy1iYW5raW5nLXNhbXBsZS1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi1jYnNhLUlCTS1EZW1vLUdQVCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/l0j8exmr#retrieving-and-processing-transaction-data)

Once the retrieval process is initiated, the system fetches the transaction data from the database. This involves executing a query to retrieve the relevant transaction records. The system ensures that the data fetched is accurate and up-to-date, which is essential for providing users with reliable transaction information.

# [Processing and Formatting the Data](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBY2ljcy1iYW5raW5nLXNhbXBsZS1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi1jYnNhLUlCTS1EZW1vLUdQVCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/l0j8exmr#retrieving-and-processing-transaction-data)

After fetching the transaction data, the system processes each transaction record. This includes handling different transaction types and formatting the transaction date and time. The processed data is then formatted into a JSON response, which is a structured format that can be easily consumed by various interfaces and applications. This step ensures that the data is presented in a user-friendly and consistent manner.

# [Terminating the Database Connection](https://app.swimm.io/repos/Z2l0aHViJTNBJTNBY2ljcy1iYW5raW5nLXNhbXBsZS1hcHBsaWNhdGlvbi1jYnNhLUlCTS1EZW1vLUdQVCUzQSUzQVN3aW1tLURlbW8=/docs/l0j8exmr#retrieving-and-processing-transaction-data)

Once the data has been processed and formatted, the system terminates the database connection. This step is important for maintaining the performance and security of the system by ensuring that database connections are not left open unnecessarily. Properly managing database connections helps prevent potential issues such as resource leaks and unauthorized access.
