The CICS Bank Sample Application (CBSA) simulates the operation of a bank from the point of view of the Bank Teller. It can be used for teaching, testing, and as a conversation piece for application development lifecycle discussions.

## Main Components

### Bank Backend

The Bank Backend is responsible for handling the backend functionality of the bank application.

### Customer Services

The main idea of Customer Services is to reduce people's queueing time by deploying staff as 'queue busters' at peak times. They will be armed with a tablet and will walk the queue to perform some of the functions of the Teller. The bank doesn't want the queue busters to become a target for robbery, so the tasks that they can perform (via the Customer Services interface) are more administrative in nature.
